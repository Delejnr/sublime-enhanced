# SublimeEnhanced

Set of plugins for beloved sublime text editor.

This set of plugins were designed for 3 purposes:

For most people it will be convinient to cherry-pick one or two packages of
sublime-enhanced that will be useful for them. If you fill like hacker and have
a free day you can try full installation.
