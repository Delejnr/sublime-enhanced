# SublimeEnhanced

Set of plugins for beloved sublime text editor.

This set of plugins were designed for 3 purposes:

  1. Mouseless usage of sublime
  2. Navigation (in code and files) improvement
  2. Common micro-tasks automation

For most people it will be convinient to cherry-pick one or two packages of
sublime-enhanced that will be useful for them. If you fill like hacker and have
a free day you can try full installation.
