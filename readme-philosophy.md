As a programmer I have my own way to solve tasks. I've programmed over years and
I would like to share my experience with other people who wants to solve
programming tasks more efficiently.

Sublime-enhanced is designed to be source-code concentrated. Source code itself
is main object to work on and should employ as much space as possible. Other
stuff is not so matter as source code and should employ as less space as
possible. Or not employ at all. This allows to developer to concentrate around
task and solve it efficiently without interruptions.

Sublime-enhanced is designed to solve code editing tasks with time as less as
possible: with few keyboard shortcuts or snippets it is possible to save a lot
of time that could be spent on thinking on the task but not typing.

Sublime-enhanced is designed to be mouseless. That means that it is better
solve all text-editing tasks with keyboard. It is much faster when you get used
to it. With keyboard you can solve any task but with mouse you can solve only
few.
